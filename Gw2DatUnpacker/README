== Authors ==

Rhoot: Main author.
Loumie: Decompression code.


== Description ==

Unpacks all files found in the input .dat file and sorts them into directories
depending on file type.


== Usage ==

It can be started as:

  Gw2DatUnpacker -i <input dat> -o <output path>

If no input dat is given, the program will ask for it. Same goes for the output
path.


== Libraries and restrictions ==

The application *may* run under Linux on little endian systems. It probably
will not run in OSX unless they recently switched to little endian systems
as well.

Required libraries:
* wxWidgets

Optional libraries:
* Visual Leak Detector

If you do not want to use Visual Leak Detector, remove the include for vld.h
in Gw2DatUnpacker.cpp.
